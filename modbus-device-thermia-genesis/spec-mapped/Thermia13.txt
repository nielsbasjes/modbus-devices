117   |  enum    | 1    | Outdoor temperature source, is an enumeration where 0 = designated PT1000 sensor located on BM-card. 1 = BMS regis- ter 40119 (De Facto). When the source is BMS the outdoor temperature alarm is automatically removed when the sensor data is valid. If no valid sensor data is present the heat pump will use its designated PT1000 sensor and if that sensor is missing the heat pump will use 0 degrees C as a fallback value.
118   |  °C      | 100  | Outdoor temperature sensor, this register will be the source of the outdoor temperature given that BMS-address 40118 is set to 1. The valid range of the temperature is between -50 to 200 degrees C. If this register is not updated with a new tempera- ture within 12 hours or the value is outside the valid range, the fallback logic will be triggered stated in description of BMS register 40118. This signal is automatically filtered in the heat pump.
